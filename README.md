# grunt-init-assemble

> Create an example project for Assemble with [grunt-init][], including unit tests.

[grunt-init]: http://gruntjs.com/project-scaffolding

## Installation
If you haven't already done so, install [grunt-init][].

Once grunt-init is installed, place this template in your `~/.grunt-init/` directory. It's recommended that you use git to clone this template into that directory, as follows:

```
git clone git@github.com:assemble/grunt-init-assemble.git ~/.grunt-init/assemble-example
```

_(Windows users, see [the documentation][grunt-init] for the correct destination directory path)_

To force `grunt-init` to use custom default values, move the `defaults.json` file to your `~/.grunt-init/` directory, and customize the values in that file.


## Usage

At the command-line, cd into an empty directory, run `grunt-init assemble` command and follow the prompts. If you want to test that it works before you customize:

 * Next, run `npm install` to install the project's dependencies.
 * Then, run `grunt` to build the project.

_Note that this template will generate files in the current directory, so be sure to change to a new directory first._
